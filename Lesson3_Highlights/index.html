            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is defined as “the task of keeping a software system consisting of many versions and configurations well organized.” It’s the concept of backing up all of the revisions to be compared, restored, and in some cases merged with other files. This allows coders and programmers to go to past versions if something is wrong with a new part of their code and go back to the version that was working and re-do the new part. It is also possible to “lock” files which allows only one developer access to change and update the code so others may read it during this process, but not edit it until it’s updated.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">GitHub</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub is a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service. It has it’s own basic features and controls and commands but also includes all the distributed source code and version code management. It is mostly used for code though and includes documentation, README files, issue tracking, commit history, integrations directory, etc. You have to have an account to contribute; users are able to discuss, manage, create repositories, submit contributions to others' repositories, and review changes to code, but public repositories can be viewed by anyone. When you are a user you can choose to make your projects private or public.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git manages projects and or files as they change and it stores this information in data structures called a repository. A remote repository is defined as “a repository that resides on a remote server that is shared among multiple team members.” And a local repository is defined as “a repository that resides on a local machine of an individual user.” You can create a local repository by creating a brand new one or cloning an existing remote repository onto your local machine. These repositories contain a set of commit objects and a set of references to commit objects called heads.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Basic Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">To navigate GitHub and it’s repositories it has a couple basic commands such as git init, git add — all, git log, git status, and more. To create a new repository you create a new directory and open it and perform a “git init” to create it. To create a log, in its simplest form, you can study repository history using “git log”. You can add a lot of parameters to make the log look like what you want. To see only the commits of a certain author: git log —author=bob. To see a very compressed log where each commit is one line: git log —pretty=oneline.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Advantages of Using a VCS</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are many advantages to using a version control system. Some of them being: every user has a complete copy of the repository data stored locally on their machine, everything is local so you can work offline, there is no single point of failure, processes run much faster, Git will prevent an unintentional overwrite of a file on the shared repository. If you’re on a team working on code with a VCS everyone is able to work freely and independently and once all the changes are made it lets you merge everyone’s work. Also just the fact that you’re able to back everything up is a huge advantage.</p>
